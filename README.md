# Performance Reports

A collection of reports from different performance analyses, usually generated using [mattermost-load-test-ng](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-load-test-ng).

This includes:
- [Performance comparisons](performance-comparisons/): a monthly regression test comparing the latest stable version of Mattermost with the one to be released.
- [Ceiling tests](ceiling-tests): suite of tests performed to inform the reference architectures, investigate the sytem bottlenecks at scale, and find out how many users the system can support.
