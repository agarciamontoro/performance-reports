// This file is not valid JSON, since it contains comments:
// - A comment following a field indicates that its value will differ
//   depending on the specific test. If the different values are just a few,
//   they are listed separated by the pipe character `|`. If there are too
//   many to list, they are simply marked as `Multiple values`.
// - A commented out section indicates that such section appears only in
//   specific tests.
